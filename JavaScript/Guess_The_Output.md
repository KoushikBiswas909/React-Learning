### Question 1

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
console.log(1+1)
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: 2
  
  Explanation: Both data type is number. So, addition of two numbers is number.
</details>

### Question 2

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
console.log( "1" + "1" );
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: 11
  
  Explanation: Both data type is string. So, addition of two strings are concatenation of strings.
               Just like `console.log( "Koushik" + " Biswas" );` will print `Koushik Biswas`.
</details>

### Question 3

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
console.log( 1 + "1" )
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: 11
  
  Explanation: One data is number, another one is string. As per code user wants to perform addition operation, 
  so javascript convert the number into a string, and performed concatination of strings.

  Javascript always tries to convert higher oder data types into lower order data type (String).
</details>

### Question 4

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Koushik',
  age: 24
}

console.log( obj + "5" )
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: [object Object]5

  Explanation: 
  1. obj is an object ‚Äì JavaScript sees obj as { name: 'Koushik', age: 24 }.
  2. obj + "5" is using the + operator ‚Äì When adding an object and a string, JavaScript tries to convert the object to a string.
  3. Object converts to "[object Object]" ‚Äì This is the default string representation of a plain object.
  4. Then it adds "5" ‚Äì So, it becomes "[object Object]" + "5".
  5. Final result: "[object Object]5"
</details>

### Question 5

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Koushik',
  age: 24
}

console.log( obj - "5" )
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: NaN
  
  Explanation:
  1. `obj` is an object ‚Äì JavaScript sees obj as `{ name: 'Koushik', age: 24 }`.
  2. `obj - "5"` uses the `-` operator `‚Äì` This operator expects numbers, not strings or objects.
  3. JavaScript tries to convert `obj` to a `number` ‚Äì But plain objects can‚Äôt be converted to a valid number directly.
  4. So, it becomes: `NaN - 5` ‚Äì And `NaN` (Not a Number) minus anything is still NaN.
  5. Final result: `NaN`
</details>

### Question 6

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
console.log( [1] + [1] );
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: 11
  
  Explanation:
  1. `[1]` is an array ‚Äì JavaScript sees it as an array with one element.
  2. Using `+` with arrays ‚Äì JavaScript tries to convert both arrays to strings.
  3. `[1].toString()` becomes `"1"` ‚Äì Each array becomes the string `"1"`.
  4. `"1" + "1"` = `"11"` ‚Äì The `+` operator joins the two strings.
  5. Final result: `"11"` (a string)
</details>

### Question 7

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
console.log( [1] - [1] );
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: 0
  
  Explanation:
  1. `[1]` is an array ‚Äì JavaScript sees it as an array with one element.
  2. Using `-` with arrays ‚Äì The `-` operator expects numbers, not arrays.
  3. JavaScript converts arrays to numbers:
      `[1].valueOf().toString()` ‚Üí "1" ‚Üí becomes 1 (a number)
  4. So it becomes: `1 - 1`
  5. Final result: `0`
</details>

### Question 8

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
console.log( [ 1, 2 ] + [ 5, 6 ] )
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: 1,25,6
  
  Explanation:
  1. `[1,2]` and `[5,6]` are arrays ‚Äì Each has multiple numbers.
  2. Using `+` with arrays ‚Äì JavaScript tries to convert both arrays to strings.
  3. `[1,2].toString()` ‚Üí `"1,2"`
  4. `[5,6].toString()` ‚Üí `"5,6"`
  5. `"1,2" + "5,6"` ‚Üí `"1,25,6"` (just string concatenation)
  6. Final result: `"1,25,6"` (a string, not an array)

     For substraction `console.log( [ 1, 2 ] - [ 5, 6 ] )` will result `NaN` because both will convert to string.
</details>

### Question 9

What will be the output of the given code snippet ?

```javascript
console.log( [ 1, 2 ] - [ 5, 6 ] )
```
<details> <summary>‚úç Show Answer & Explanation</summary>
  Answer: `NaN` 
  
  Explanation:
  1. Expression: `[1, 2] - [5, 6]`
  2. Subtraction operator (-): JavaScript tries to convert both arrays to primitives (usually strings or numbers) before performing subtraction.
  3. Array to primitive:
     `[1, 2].toString()` ‚Üí `'1,2'`
     `[5, 6].toString()` ‚Üí `'5,6'`
  4. Subtraction attempt: `'1,2' - '5,6'`
  5. String subtraction: JavaScript tries to convert both strings to numbers.
  6. `'1,2'` and `'5,6'` are not valid numbers ‚Üí conversion fails.
  7. Result: Invalid numeric operation ‚Üí `NaN` (Not a Number)
